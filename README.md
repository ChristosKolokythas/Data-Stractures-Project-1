# Data-Stractures-Project-1

1.Functionality
The program simulates the operation of a bank and more specifically the temporal interactions between teller and customer. The user can specify the bank's operating time,the probability of a customer's arrival at any given time as well as the maximum possible service time and the number of teller counters. With this data the program is able to inform him about the number of customers served, the time for which the teller remained idle, the time the cashier remained busy for each cashier separately. It also informs us of the time the bank remained open and the additional time it took to serve all customers who had entered the bank before it closed and the average time customers waited in the bank until they were served.

2.Instructions
 Once the program starts running a message appears asking the user to enter some values. These values are: a positive integer corresponding to the bank's operating time units, a decimal number in the interval (0,1) corresponding to the probability of leaving a customer, an integer greater than or equal to 1 corresponding to the maximum service time, and finally a positive integer for the number of tills.Then the program is executed as described above.
 
3.Implementation and Testing Environment
The program was implemented in a Windows environment using the DevC++ program.
